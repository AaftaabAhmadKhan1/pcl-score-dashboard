## üîí Important: Secure Your API Key

Before uploading to GitHub, you might want to hide your API key:

### Option 1: Keep it as is (Simple but Less Secure)
- API key is visible in code
- Restrict it in Google Cloud Console to your domain only

### Option 2: Use Environment Variables (More Secure)
1. Create `.env` file (already in .gitignore)
2. Move API key there
3. Use Vercel environment variables

For this project, **Option 1 is fine** since you'll restrict the API key to your deployed domain.
